<h1>AdFly ViewBot?</h1>
<h3> You are at the right place.</h3>

But you have to make take small steps before you get started, and they are easy-peasy. Kindly read this completely to avoid any mistake.<br><br>
***<h4>If you face any problem, feel free to contact me, via Instagram, GitHub Issues or e-Mail</h4>***
Skip any part if you have it already:

First go ahead and create an account on https://windscribe.com/ Your VirtualMachine will use this VPN to view AdFly pages from different IPs. Also verify your account for total of 10 GB data per month<br><br>
Secondly download and install python https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.7/python-3.9.7-amd64.exe and Oracle VirtualBox https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.34/VirtualBox-6.1.34-150636-Win.exe if you don't have it already (leave all options during installing as default, doesn't matter)<br><br>
Thirdly download the user_login.py file from this repository and run it. This file is your way to create your own account in my server, you need to add your AdFly IDs via this file, the AdFly IDs added to your account in my server are the ones your VirtualMachines will view.<br><br>
AdFly ID refers to the number in your AdFly referral code for e.g. for some with referral code https://join-adf.ly/654321 their ID is 654321 <br>
Lastly download the latest version of VirtualMachine from this Group (Join the Google group, download the VM and leave the group). https://groups.google.com/g/adfly-client-vm <br><br>
Once all your AdFly IDs are added, you are done, just add the Virtual_machine to VirtualBox, start it, open WindScribe VPN (it will be preinstalled) and login with the account you created earlier, also you will find a minimised script running, click on it and add your Username (as created in my Server). Now restart the VirtualMachine and forget about it. It will work perpetually, all updates required to the code are done directly by my Server.

<h2>And This Should Work!!!</h2>

<h3>Some Advanced Stuff:</h3>
* Go slow or you might get banned by AdFly. <br>
Yes you can run several copies of the VM and run them all together, this will increase your earnings in scale.
But there is a (very low) chance that your AdFly account might get banned for using this bot at a fast rate. Go slow, take your time, Run lesser number of VMs initially, find what is the best rate for you, then gradually increase if you want to.
* Don't blame me if any AdFly account gets banned<br>
***Remember If your AdFly ID gets banned, its withdrawal email gets frozen (You can't add that withdrawal email to a new AdFly account) so always bind disposable AdFly accounts to this bot*** <br>
Create fake AdFly IDs to use with this bot, accounts that won't cause problems if banned. AdFly allows account creation with disposable emails https://www.emailondeck.com/ and https://www.mohmal.com/en
* This bot is still in its Beta phase. <br>
Meaning there are still bugs, issues, and thus need lots of improvements, maybe you incur a bug, some unexpected behaviour, kindly report it to me if possible, I am always open for suggestions, new ideas or fixes.
* Multiple VMs can be run at the same time.
The code I made is extremely efficient, and you can run multiple VMs at once. To do so, either download a fresher copy of VM from Google link, or you can clone the VM ***before logging into WindScribe***, if you clone after login, it might cause problems because of same account active in 2 devices. Same Username(of my server) can however be used in multiple VMs.
